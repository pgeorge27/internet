reserves the right, at its exclusive discretion, to verify or authenticate any
payment order or other related act, by subsequent telephone calls to the
Authorized Account Holder or by any other means that the BANK considers
appropriate, but its failure to verify or authenticate any of the said
instructions shall not be evidence of failure to use reasonable care or good

implemented without reference to same by an Authorized Account Holder and the
CUSTOMER shall be responsible for keeping the said password, code or number
confidential. Any failure to comply with confidentiality must be reported
immediately to the BANK's  Customer Service Area.  The BANK's own records
evidencing that a person issuing a payment order used the password, code or
