shall reject said payment orders.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span

consider the number of a payment order that identifies an intermediary bank or the
beneficiary’s bank, even if the bank identified is different from the bank
identified by name in the payment order, in the event that the BANK is not
aware of said inconsistency in the identification.  Similarly, the BANK may
consider the number of a payment order that identifies the beneficiary, even if
the same identifies a person or an entity different than the person or entity
identified by name in the payment order, in the event that the BANK is not
aware of said inconsistency in the identification. The BANK is not obliged to

obliged to track any payment order made by the CUSTOMER or to search for
evidence that the payment orders made by the CUSTOMER to any account designated

directions and instructions related to the payment order, including the
cancellation or amendment of previous instructions related to said payment
order, which may be made by the BANK from time to time, by any Accountholder or
any person that purports to be an Authorized Accountholder.  In the event of an
amendment or cancellation to a payment order that has been executed, the BANK
may, but shall not be obliged to, attempt to recover the funds of the
beneficiary by using any step that it deems reasonable to attain the same and
the CUSTOMER states that it shall compensate the BANK for any cost, expense,
damage or liability, including lawyer’s fees, which the BANK may incur in its
attempt to perform said recovery of the funds.  However, the BANK does not need
to follow the claim beyond the normal commercial steps or in any event, resort

a receiving bank or the beneficiary’s bank, rejects a payment order, the BANK
shall notify the undersigned, orally, electronically or in writing that the
BANK is rejecting or has rejected and shall not pay or accept a payment order. 
The BANK shall not be liable for any damage due to its rejection of any payment
order.</span></p>

account/deposit which includes the payment orders.  No later than 10 calendar
days after the receipt of said confirmation or periodical statement, the
CUSTOMER shall cause it to be examined and shall immediately notify the BANK of
any unauthorized or erroneously executed payment order.  THE CUSTOMER’S OMISSION,
AFTER RECEIVING SAID NOTICE, OF REPORTING ANY UNAUTHORIZED OR ERRONEOUSLY
EXECUTED PAYMENT ORDER SHALL EXEMPT THE BANK FROM ANY LIABILITY OF PAYING
INTERESTS ON ANY NON-REIMBURSABLE AMOUNT IN REGARDS THERETO.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>F.3.C. The payment to
the CUSTOMER by the BANK, where the BANK is the bank of the beneficiary, shall occur
when the first of the following events takes place: when the amount of the
payment order is credited to an account of the beneficiary at the BANK, when a
credit notice sent to the beneficiary or when the BANK legally applies the
credit to a debt of the beneficiary.  If the BANK in its capacity as the
beneficiary’s bank, accepts a payment order for the CUSTOMER, regardless if
said payment order orders payment to an account of the CUSTOMER, the BANK may,
but shall not be obliged to, give notice of said acceptance to the CUSTOMER.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>F.3.D. Any interest that
the BANK is required to pay to the CUSTOMER shall be limited to the interest
calculated by multiplying the deposit rate payable on the following day to the BANK
for the amount on which interests are paid, and then by multiplying this
product by the real number of days for which interests are paid divided by the
real number of days in the year.</span></p>

also compensate and hold the BANK harmless from and against any and all costs,
claims, expenses, damages and liabilities (collectively called the &quot;Claims&quot;)
relating to any action that may be taken by any person against the BANK as a
result of any transactions stipulated in this Agreement, excluding when said
Claim is the exclusive result of gross negligence or willful wrongful misconduct
by the BANK.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>F.5. The BANK shall not
be liable for any payment order made or any other act executed by the BANK related
to said payment order, or any damage or loss coming from the same, if said
payment order or act is given by a BANK officer, Accountholder or employee
pursuant to instructions given in writing, electronically or orally (including
by telephone or fax), which said officer, Accountholder or employee, reasonably
and in bona fides believes that comes from an Authorized Accountholder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>F.6.A. The CUSTOMER agrees
that the BANK shall not be liable for any mistake, discrepancy or delay on
behalf of any intermediary bank, funds transfer system used by the BANK in the
transmission of said payment order, the cancellation or amendment of any

lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>F.7.A.  Alter receiving
a payment order, the BANK reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to verify
or authenticate any payment order or any other related act, by making
subsequent phone calls to the Accountholder Authorized by the CUSTOMER or by
any other means that the BANK deems appropriate, but its omission in verifying
or authenticating any of said instructions shall not be evidence that
reasonable care or goodwill were taken.  The BANK shall not be liable if its
rejects a payment order or executes any related act if the BANK in bona fides
cannot establish on its own that the instructions were given by the Authorized
Accountholder.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>F.7.B. When the CUSTOMER
is the one that sends the payment order, the CUSTOMER authorizes the BANK to
obtain a payment order by debiting the amount of the payment order from any of
the amounts that the undersigned has at the BANK.  The BANK shall not be
required to execute any payment order unless the undersigned has in deposit
with the BANK sufficient funds to cover said payment order.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>F.8.A. The BANK may
assign to each CUSTOMER a keyword, password or confidential number as part of a
security procedure to verify the authenticity of a payment order or the
cancellation or amendment of a payment order. It shall be the Customer’s responsibility
to safeguard said keyword, password or confidential number.  If the BANK assigns
a keyword, password or confidential number, payment orders shall not be executed
without reference to said keyword, password or number by an Authorized
Accountholder and the CUSTOMER is responsible of maintaining the
confidentiality of its keyword, password or assigned number.  Any default in
confidentiality must be immediately reported to the Bank’s Customer Service
Area.  The Bank’s own registries evidencing that the person that is making the
payment order used the keyword, password or assigned number shall be conclusive
evidence that the person was an Authorized Accountholder and that the payment
was done properly in the amounts indicated in said registries.  The CUSTOMER is
responsible of limiting access to this code, password or number only to
authorized personnel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>F.8.B. The CUSTOMER consents
to tape recordings by the BANK of payment orders instructions or related acts
in regards thereto given by telephone, but their omission in making said
recordings shall not be deemed an omission in the exercise of reasonable care
and bona fides.  The CUSTOMER agrees to compensate and exempt the BANK from any
cost, expense, damage and liability, including lawyer’s fees, in which the BANK
may incur as a result or due to the use of said recordings.</span></p>

Bear in mind that your Helm Virtual software is a valuable object; therefore,
it is important that you take care of it.  Never lend it.  Make sure you do not
disclose you Personal Identification Number (PIN); this number is an important
way of protecting yourself. Do not write it in your computer nor in any of the
materials of the same. Contact us immediately if you believe you have been
robbed or if your access software has been lost, or if you think an
unauthorized person has had access to your PIN.  The telephone is the quickest
means to let us know that somebody could be using your software or PIN.  Call
The BANK at the number that appears in Section L of this Agreement.  If you are
unable to call us by telephone, write to us at the address that appears in
Section L.  Limit your liability by notifying us promptly.</span></p>

All Electronic Transfers carried out will be considered as carried out by you. 
The BANK is not liable for losses or damages caused by fraudulent, negligent or
unauthorized use of your PIN.  All adverse consequences derived from such

or in detriment of yourself will be your responsibility exclusively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

When the BANK has received notice that your PIN is public knowledge, the BANK
will adopt, in turn, the measures within its reach, at your cost, to lessen the
risks.  You release the BANK and will not hold the same liable for damages that
